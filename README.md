# react-native-otp-autocomplete
This library was forked from [react-native-otp-autocomplete](https://github.com/jmlavoier/react-native-otp-autocomplete).

It uses Automatic SMS Verification with the SMS Retriever API.
With the SMS Retriever API, you can perform SMS-based user verification in your Android app automatically, without requiring the user to manually type verification codes, and without requiring any extra app permissions.

 ## Message Format/Structure
 In order to detect the message, SMS message must include a hash that identifies your app. This hash can be obtained by using the getHash() method below.

 Please read the official documentation for the message structure at this
[Google developer guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/sms-retriever/verify)

## Getting started

`$ npm install github:csoft-tech/react-native-otp-autocomplete --save`
 or
`$ yarn add github:csoft-tech/react-native-otp-autocomplete`

### Using React Native Link (React Native 0.59 and lower)

  	```

## Usage
```javascript

const getHash = () =>
    OtpAutocomplete.getHash()
    .then(console.log)
    .catch(console.log);

const startListeningForOtp = () =>
    OtpAutocomplete.getOtp()
    .then(p => OtpAutocomplete.addListener(otpHandler))
    .catch(p => console.log(p));

const otpHandler = (message: string) => {
        const otp = /(\d{4})/g.exec(message)[1];
        this.setState({ otp });
